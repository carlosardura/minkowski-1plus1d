# Interactive Visualization of Special Relativity via Minkowski 1+1D Diagrams

This project develops a Python-based tool designed to represent Minkowski diagrams in 1+1 dimensions, with the purpose of visualizing key concepts in Special Relativity, including Lorentz transformations and the geometric structure of Minkowski spacetime.

At the undergraduate level, the study of Special Relativity often relies heavily on intuition and abstraction, which limits students’ ability to internalize fundamental geometric principles. Although core concepts such as simultaneity, invariant intervals, and the behavior of spacetime are introduced through dense mathematical formalism, the absence of visual support can obscure the connection between algebraic expressions and their geometric interpretation.

The aim of this project is to serve as a pedagogical aid that strengthens conceptual understanding by providing an interactive framework suitable both for classroom demonstrations and for independent study, bridging the gap between formalism and intuition. Users can explore the geometric foundations of Special Relativity explicitly.
